GENIE3 (GEne Network Inference with Ensemble of trees): Inference of gene regulatory networks from gene expression data

GENIE3 is now available from [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/GENIE3.html). A **tutorial** [(vignette)](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/GENIE3/inst/doc/GENIE3.html) is included in the package.


To install GENIE3 (from Bioconductor development branch), you can run the following commands from R:
```
install.packages("https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/src/contrib/GENIE3_0.99.7.tar.gz", repos=NULL)

# You might need to install these packages first:
install.packages(c("stats", "reshape2"))
```

To install GENIE3 (with multi-node parallelism and progress bar features), you can run the following commands from R:
```
install_git("git://github.com/mase5/GENIE3.git", branch = "mnp_pb_features")
